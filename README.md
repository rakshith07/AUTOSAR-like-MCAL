# AUTOSAR-like-MCAL
A simple repository to use highly accessible, inexpensive STM32 MCU for the development of MCAL in AUTOSAR like Architecture
The repository is going to evovle over time and the purpose of the whole project is to understand the fundamentals of AutoSAR base software.
The contents are mostly developed by the author and the author holds the complete rights over the contents.
Feel free to use the contents of the repository for educational pupose only.
Contents of the repository is not to be used for commercial purpose and never to be used on a realtime systems as none of the modules as tested for safety relavant applications.

Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! If you've identified improvements, corrections, or additional learning resources, feel free to submit a pull request. Let's grow and enhance this learning kit together.

Happy coding and welcome to the world of AutoSAR basics!
